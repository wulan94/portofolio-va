# Customizing and Deploying Portfolio Website

## Overview
This documentation will guide you through the steps to customize your portfolio website and deploy it on GitHub Pages.

## Customizing Your Portfolio
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wulan94/portofolio-va.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Your Code Editor**  
   Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, Atom) to open the project folder.

3. **Modify the Content**  
   - Navigate to the `index.html` file to update your personal information, including your name, bio, and contact details.
   - Edit the CSS file in the `css` folder to change the styles as per your preference.
   - Update the images in the `images` folder by replacing them with your own.

4. **Add New Sections**  
   If you want to add new sections to your portfolio (like projects or testimonials), modify the `index.html` and implement the changes in the respective CSS files.

5. **Test Locally**  
   Open the modified `index.html` file in your web browser to see the changes in action.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages

   After making your customizations, add, commit, and push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Customize portfolio"  
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**

   - Click on the `Settings` tab.
   - Scroll down to the `Pages` section.
   - Under `Source`, select the `main` branch and click `Save`.

3. **Access Your Live Site**
